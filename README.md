# MiniProject_parkisons
This project predicts whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements. The system uses machine learning algorithms trained on real-world datasets to identify key vocal features linked to Parkinson’s symptoms. It provides an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for users to input their data and get instant predictions.

✨ Features:

Predicts Parkinson’s disease with high accuracy

Interactive Streamlit-based web interface

Uses pre-trained machine learning model

Accepts multiple input parameters (MDVP features, jitter, shimmer, etc.)

Fast and lightweight — deployable via Streamlit Cloud

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

Streamlit – for web app interface

Scikit-learn – for ML model training

NumPy & Pandas – for data handling

Pickle – for model serialization

🚀 How to Run Locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:

streamlit run app.py
