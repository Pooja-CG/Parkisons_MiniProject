# MiniProject_parkisons
This project predicts whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements. The system uses machine learning algorithms trained on real-world datasets to identify key vocal features linked to Parkinson’s symptoms. It provides an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for users to input their data and get instant predictions.
